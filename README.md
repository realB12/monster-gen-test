# monster-gen-test :: MonsterGen Theme PUBLIC Website



## README
Part of the [bsPub program](../../../_bsPUB.md) this `monster-gen-test` folder provides the **<u>PUBLIC facing Website</u> for "selling" the MonsterGen-Theme. 

The [MonsterGen Project](_monster-gen-test.md) **explores the best, fully automated way for hugo-generating websites from [West-Wind.com's MarkDown Monster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/) edited `*.md` file repos**, so that the resulting website's look and feel mimics the Monster Editor's GUI (in read only mode).

Goal here is to **develop a state of the art HUGO Theme Go Module** that is doing all this. 

This Website includes a documentation set and test-cases for external parties when wanting to contribute to the MonsterGen project.
