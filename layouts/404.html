404.html
from the /layouts folder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Template renders the static "file not found"-page, which does not render 
content of another page, but contains the "content" in itself.

Following Hugo's internal lookup priorities, this template inherits from the 
_default/base.html Base-Template that again defines the settings for left-side
positioned navbar, the header and the footer.

Mind the fact that all the Websites META-flags, favicons etc. are all generated 
in the header component. So the homepage is really and only about the rendering 
of the index/list and content information.
