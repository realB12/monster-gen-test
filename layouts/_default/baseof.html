Notes on commenting out Template Brackets
===============================================================================
Problem: 
========
As Hugo will replace Brackets even in Comments you cannot just out-comment
such Brackets, as Hugo will still try to resolve its code and will return with 
an error and will stop further execution when an error occures. 

Solution:
=========
Replace Brackets with < !--- --- >
Mind the THREE ---
The so marked-content will be handled as comment but is still specially marked to distinguish it from normal comments and therefore can still be mutated back to Brackets
