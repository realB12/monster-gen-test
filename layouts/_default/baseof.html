Notes on commenting out Template Bracket such as 
===============================================================================
Problem: 
As Hugo will replace Brackets even in Comments you cannot just out-comment
such Brackets as Hugo will still try to resolve its code and will return with 
an error and will stop further execution when an error occures. 
Solution
Replace Brackets with < !--- --- >
The so marked-content will be handled as comment but can still be mutated back 
to Brackets
