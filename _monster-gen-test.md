# MonsterGen Dev&Test-Workbench Folder

--> [monster-gen Project Charter](../monter-gen/_Monster_Generator.md)

## README
This TEMPORARY `monster-gen-test` folder is for DEVELOPMENT only and it is temporarily used for continuously building, improving documenting and testing the MonsterGen-Theme step by step before it goes into the monster-gen project's [monster-demo folder](../monster-gen/monster-dem/_monster-demo.md). Its content is **work in progress and might therefore be unstable**!!

Current theme is developed in the `/layouts` folder (not the themes folder yet)

Final results, including in-line comments and additional help-docs will be copied from this `/layouts` folder to the `monster-gen/monster-demo/themes/layouts` folder where it will be tested when setup as a theme.

The MonsterGen Project **explores the best, fully automated way to hugo-generate websites from [West-Wind.coms's MarkDown Monster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/) edited `*.md` file Repos**, so that the resulting website's look and behavior mimics the Monster Editor's GUI in read only mode.

Goal here is to **develop a state of the art HUGO Theme Go Module** that is doing all this. 

This Website includes some documentation and test-cases for external parties willing to contribute to the MonsterGen project.
