# monster-gen-test :: MonsterGen Theme PUBLIC Website

## README
This TEMPORARY `monster-gen-test` folder is for DEVELOPMENT and used for building and testing the MonsterGen-Theme step by step. Its content is work in progress and might therefore be unstable!!

Final results will be copied to the `monster-demo` folder of the `monster-gen` project folder

The MonsterGen Project **explores the best, fully automated way to hugo-generate Websites from [West-Wind.coms's MarkDown Monster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/) edited `*.md` file Repos**, so that the resulting website's look and behavior mimics the Monster Editor's GUI in read only mode.

Goal here is to **develop a state of the art HUGO Theme Go Module** that is doing all this. 

This Website includes a documentation set and testcases for external parties when wantig to contribute to the MonsterGen project.
